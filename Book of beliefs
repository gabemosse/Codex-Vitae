# Beliefs about how things are and how they should be
Author: Gabriel Mossé

*What is this document?* This public, living, document was created on a Sunday in November 2021. It’s a way for me to start understanding - and remember - who I am, catch inconsistencies in how I respond to different events in the world, react to current events from a position of how I believe the world is, should be, and will become. I'll update it once a year, and all changes are tracked. Rather than attempting to avoid all errors in this doc, I'm attempting to be as specific as possible and to quickly correct errors when they become apparent.

*Why does it exist?* My main goal here is to develop a code to live by, one that can be constantly updated. The work done in creating this initial code is not to simply state what I believe, but to ask the questions in areas where I may truly not yet understand what I believe - or not yet have enough information to confidently state what I believe. My secondary goal is to allow me to get smarter over time by identifying new connections and inconsistencies so I can course-correct when necessary. I am keeping this public so that others can hold me accountable.

*Who's beliefs are these?* I'm Gabriel Mossé. These beliefs are my best guess and articulation of my own beliefs, which were inherited and molded partly by the environment I've lived in and partly by my own interpretation of life experiences. Your mileage may vary. Caveat lector.

## Beliefs
A belief is a personal interpretation of available experience and data on a given subject. The subject can be anything, from "what is the best burrito in SF?" to "how did the universe begin and how will it end?" to "how easy should it be to buy a gun?" and beyond. I've broken them up into two broad categories: 1) beliefs about how things are / seem to be (both objectively and subjectively), and 2) how I believe things should be (aka the change I want to see in the world).

### HOW THINGS ARE: On the nature of reality and how things are
How nature, consciousness, and the universe seem to be to me (both objectively and subjectively).

*Earth: civilization's arrow of progress*

* Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others.

*Life: aliens*

* Non-carbon-based life forms exist.
* Aliens are unlikely to be aggressive. Any sufficient reason to come specifically to us is unlikely to be motivated by typical warlike intentions, because we don't have anything special in the universe that they can't get elsewhere for cheaper.

*Life: consciousness and free will*

* The sensation of consciousness is real.

*Life: medicine*

* A lot about health and medicine is mental, which opens the door for things like placebo effect and fake remedies.

*Life: origins*

* Within this universe, we evolved through natural systems that required no outside intervention.

*Life: existential threats to us*

* Aliens pose a <0.001% existential threat to us.
* If and when humans become extinct, the Earth will barely notice (perhaps just giving a long sigh of relief).

*Philosophy: death and the afterlife*

* We will die.
* There is no afterlife.
* We are part of a larger system that cycles materials through processes that include what we call life, as well as many other things (like tectonic movement, weather systems, the magnetic field, the cycling of water, carbon, and many other molecules and compounds).
* Dirt is what living things do in times between being alive.

*Philosophy: purpose of life*

* There is no singular purpose or meaning granted to our lives. 
* It's okay to identify our own objectives in life and call them a purpose.
* Memento mori is a useful tool for remembering you're alive. (trying this on)

*Pseudoscience: astrology*

* Astrology can be fun entertainment, like the Myers Briggs test.
* Astrology can stunt healthier forms of analysis if taken literally and seriously.
